Description:
This file contains functions/menus/commands/abbreviations to make Vim an
Oracle SQL*Plus IDE.
Here are the main highlights of this script:

- SqlMake(): lets you open any stored procedure and compile from within vim.
	 Will display and optionally highlight the errors, navigate
	 thru errors in the quickfix mode.
	
- Adds a SQL*Plus menu

- SqlPlus(): lets you start an external SQL*Plus, execute the whole file
	 contents in SQL*Plus and return the results back in the same
	 buffer, or select a portion of the buffer, execute it and
	 display the results in a new buffer.

- GetSource(): get the stored procedure code from the database

- Abbreviations: lot of abbreviations to make coding in PL/SQL a breeze,
	 all accessible thru menu as well

Mappings:

  <Leader>c	Select Database dialog
  <Leader>C	Get column names for the tablename under cursor
  <Leader>F	Stored procedure code from DB for the function/procedure name
  		under cursor
  <Leader>i	Find Invalid Objects
  CTRL+S 		Start SQL*Plus window (external)
  <Leader>r	Execute current file in SQL*Plus window (external)
  <Leader>s	Execute current file in SQL*Plus and get the result to same
  		buffer
  <Leader>s	Execute current selection in SQL*Plus and get the result to a
  		new window

  Following mappings from ftplugin sql.vim
  <C-D>		Describe the object under cursor
  <LocalLeader>d	make a dbms_output.put_line statement for word/selection
  		below current line
  <LocalLeader>D	make a dbms_output.put_line statement for word/selection
  		above current line


Optional files:
  sql.vim	- sql filetype plugin load to your ftplugin folders. This file is
  		  needed for Abbreviations and some mappings

Note:
	I have tested this only under gvim6.0 on Win2000 and Oracle 8.1.5. I do
	not have any other platform to test these.
